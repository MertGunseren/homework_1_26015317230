	<h2>Near Edinburgh Castle for foods and drinks</h2>
	
	<p>Edinburgh Castle is the most famous landmark in Scotland's capital.</p>
	<p>After a day of sightseeing, many visitors are in need of a convenient</p>
	<p>yet luxurious restaurant in which to enjoy an evening meal.</p>
	
	<img src="p3.jpg" alt="The Witchery by the Castle">
	<h2>The Witchery by the Castle </h2>
	<br>
	<p>This boutique Gothic hotel is popular with Edinburgh residents, visitors and celebrities alike.</p>
	<p>Andrew Lloyd Webber once asked “Is this the prettiest restaurant ever?” and we are inclined to agree.</p>
	<p>The restaurant is housed in a 16th century merchant’s house, just at the gates of Edinburgh Castle.</p>
	<p>The interior is decorated with carved oak panelling, antique candlesticks and tapestries.</p>
	<p>The ceiling is painted with heraldry, reminiscent of the Auld Alliance with France.</p>
	<p>But it is the food, of course, which takes centre stage.</p>
	<p>Scottish produce is a must, comprising the finest seafood, beef, lamb and game that the country has to offer.</p>
	<p>The Angus beef steak tartare is a particularly lavish dish. Vegetarians are sure to enjoy the fabulous courgette, </p>
	<p>chickpea and tofu tagine.</p>
	<p> Three courses cost £36.</p>
	<br>
	
	<img src="p4.jpg" alt="Castle Terrace Restaurant" width="1000">
	<h2>Castle Terrace Restaurant</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Dominic Jack is the head chef of this Michelin star establishment. Jack was trained in some of France’s finest </p>
	<p>restaurants, including l’Arpège in Paris.</p>
	<p>The restaurant was opened in 2010, and underwent a major refurbishment in 2016. The décor is characterised by </p>
	<p>calming, neutral tones, with splashes of rich blues and golds. There is an impressive mural of Edinburgh Castle on </p>
	<p>the wall, blending the ancient and the modern.</p>
	<p>The Castle Terrace is the sister restaurant of The Kitchin, and they both have the same commendable motto: “From Nature to Plate”.</p>
	<p>Locally sourced ingredients are cooked to perfection using classic French techniques. You can sample such delights </p>
	<p>as monkfish, Ayrshire pork, or Inverurie lamb.</p>
	<p>The surprise tasting menu costs £80.</p>
    <br>
	
	<img src="p5.jpg" alt="Timberyard">
	<h2>Timberyard</h2>
	<p>The family-run Timberyard restaurant is the perfect place for those who are passionate about quality ingredients.</p>
	<p>All the kitchen’s produce is from local artisan growers, breeders, suppliers and foragers.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, the wines are from small European producers, and the herbs are from Timberyard’s own raised beds.</p>
	<p>The building itself is an old brick warehouse, kitted out with a cosy wood-burning stove.</p>
	<p>The dishes do not have names – the menu lets the ingredients speak for themselves.</p>
	<p>Why not try some duck with parsnip, ramson, onion and black garlic? Or perhaps turbot, with celery, salsify, sea beet and artichoke?</p>
	<p>The restaurant has of logs, rough wood tables and substantial pottery, which hint at the warehouse’s industrial origins.</p>
	<p>A four course dinner costs £55, and paired drinks costs $40.</p>
