	<h2>1.Edinburgh Castle</h2>
	<img src="p6.jpg" alt="Edinburgh Castle" width="1000">
	<br>
	<p>Scotland's most famous landmark, Edinburgh Castle is one of Britain's most visited</p>
	<p>tourist attractions. Highlights include the One O'clock Salute from Half Moon Battery</p>
	<p>(cannon fire commemorates the tradition of helping ships synchronize their clocks); the</p>
	<p>impressive Scottish National War Memorial; and the stunning collection of Crown</p>
	<p>Jewels housed in the Royal Palace. Another notable feature is the Stone of Destiny</p>
	<p>(aka, the Stone of Scone), famously stolen by Edward I and placed under the English</p>
	<p>throne in London - only returned to Scotland 700 years later in 1996.</p>
	<p>If you want to save time, consider purchasing a Skip the Line: Edinburgh Castle</p>
	<p>Entrance Ticket, so you can spend more time touring the castle instead of waiting in the long lines.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Address: Castle Hill, Edinburgh</p>

	<h2>2 Palace of Holyroodhouse and Holyrood Abbey</h2>
	<img src="p7.jpg" alt="Palace of Holyroodhouse and Holyrood Abbey" width="1000">
	<br>
	<p>The Palace of Holyroodhouse is the Queen's official Edinburgh residence and has</p>
	<p>frequently been at the center of Scottish history: it was where James II and James IV</p>
	<p>were each married, where James V and Charles I were crowned, and where "Bonnie </p>
	<p>Prince Charlie" held court in 1745. When the Queen's away, public access is permitted </p>
	<p>to the stunning Historic Apartments (former home of Mary Queen of Scots) and the </p>
	<p>State Apartments, famous for their fine furnishings, tapestries, and plasterwork.</p>
	<p>The Great Gallery displays portraits of Scottish kings, both legendary and real. The </p>
	<p>Queen's Gallery, opened in 2002 as part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations, hosts  </p>
	<p>changing exhibitions from the Royal Collection. The neighboring 12th-century </p>
	<p>Holyrood Abbey was founded by King David I.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Location: Royal Mile, Edinburgh</p>

	<h2>3.The Royal Mile</h2>
	<img src="p7.jpg" alt="The Royal Mile" width="1000">
	<br>
	<p>The Royal Mile refers to the streets linking Edinburgh Castle and the Palace of </p>
	<p>Holyroodhouse. Lined with charming townhouses, churches, and historic landmarks, </p>
	<p>this splendid thoroughfare is a place to stroll for its shops (including kiltmakers), inns, </p>
	<p>museums, caf√©s, and restaurants. Many of the buildings are tall, averaging six to 15 </p>
	<p>stories and referred to locally as "lands." Narrow little alleys, called "winds," with the </p>
	<p>hidden backyard "closes," weave in and around them.</p>
